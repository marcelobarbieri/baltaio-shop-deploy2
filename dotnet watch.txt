dotnet-watch

  Environment variables:

    DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER
    When set to '1' or 'true', dotnet-watch will poll the file system for
    changes. This is required for some file systems, such as network shares,
    Docker mounted volumes, and other virtual file systems.

    DOTNET_WATCH
    dotnet-watch sets this variable to '1' on all child processes launched.

    DOTNET_WATCH_ITERATION
    dotnet-watch sets this variable to '1' and increments by one each time
    a file is changed and the command is restarted.

  Remarks:
    The special option '--' is used to delimit the end of the options and
    the beginning of arguments that will be passed to the child dotnet process.
    Its use is optional. When the special option '--' is not used,
    dotnet-watch will use the first unrecognized argument as the beginning
    of all arguments passed into the child dotnet process.

    For example: dotnet watch -- --verbose run

    Even though '--verbose' is an option dotnet-watch supports, the use of '--'
    indicates that '--verbose' should be treated instead as an argument for
    dotnet-run.

  Examples:
    dotnet watch run
    dotnet watch test
